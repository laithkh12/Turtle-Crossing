# üê¢ Turtle Crossing Game

A fun Turtle Crossing game built in Python, where the player navigates a turtle to cross a busy road. The player must avoid incoming cars to successfully cross and increase their level, with each level adding more speed and challenge. üõ£Ô∏èüöó

## üéÆ Game Features
- **Player Movement**: Move the turtle upward using the **Up Arrow** key.
- **Randomly Generated Cars**: Cars of various colors move horizontally across the screen.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks the player's current level.
- **Game Over**: Game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modules and Classes

### `main.py`
The main script that initializes the game environment, controls the game loop, and handles collisions and level-ups.

```python
import time
from turtle import Screen
from player import Player
from car_manager import CarManager
from scoreboard import Scoreboard

screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.tracer(0)

player = Player()
car_manager = CarManager()  # Car manager for handling all car operations
scoreBoard = Scoreboard()

screen.listen()
screen.onkey(player.goUp, "Up")

game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    screen.update()
    car_manager.createCar()
    car_manager.moveCars()

    # Detect collision with car
    for car in car_manager.allCars:
        if car.distance(player) < 20:
            game_is_on = False
            scoreBoard.gameOver()

    # Detect successful crossing
    if player.isAtFinishLine():
        player.goToStart()
        car_manager.levelUp()
        scoreBoard.increaseLevel()

screen.exitonclick()
```

### player.py
Defines the Player class, representing the turtle that the player controls. The turtle moves up and resets to the starting position upon a successful crossing.
```python
from turtle import Turtle

STARTING_POSITION = (0, -280)
MOVE_DISTANCE = 10
FINISH_LINE_Y = 280

class Player(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("turtle")
        self.penup()
        self.goToStart()
        self.setheading(90)

    def goUp(self):
        self.forward(MOVE_DISTANCE)

    def goToStart(self):
        self.goto(STARTING_POSITION)

    def isAtFinishLine(self):
        return self.ycor() > FINISH_LINE_Y
```

### scoreboard.py
The Scoreboard class manages the game level and displays a game-over message when the turtle collides with a car.
```python
from turtle import Turtle

FONT = ("Courier", 24, "normal")

class Scoreboard(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.level = 1
        self.hideturtle()
        self.penup()
        self.goto(-280, 250)
        self.updateScoreBoard()

    def updateScoreBoard(self):
        self.clear()
        self.write(f"Level: {self.level}", align='left', font=FONT)

    def increaseLevel(self):
        self.level += 1
        self.updateScoreBoard()

    def gameOver(self):
        self.goto(0, 0)
        self.write("GAME OVER", align="center", font=FONT)
```

### car_manager.py
The CarManager class handles car creation, movement, and increasing the car speed with each level-up.
```python
from turtle import Turtle
import random

COLORS = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
STARTING_MOVE_DISTANCE = 5
MOVE_INCREMENT = 10

class CarManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.allCars = []
        self.carSpeed = STARTING_MOVE_DISTANCE

    def createCar(self):
        randomChance = random.randint(1, 6)
        if randomChance == 1:
            newCar = Turtle("square")
            newCar.shapesize(stretch_wid=1, stretch_len=2)
            newCar.penup()
            newCar.color(random.choice(COLORS))
            randomY = random.randint(-250, 250)
            newCar.goto(300, randomY)
            self.allCars.append(newCar)

    def moveCars(self):
        for car in self.allCars:
            car.backward(self.carSpeed)

    def levelUp(self):
        self.carSpeed += MOVE_INCREMENT
```
